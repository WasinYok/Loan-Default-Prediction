# Loan-Default-Prediction
A machine learning project predicting loan defaults with models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost. Includes hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, and visualizations to assess credit risk and model effectiveness.

# Features :

- Data Analysis: EDA on borrower income, loan amount, and interest rate.
- Predictive Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost.
- Performance Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
- Visualizations: Heatmaps and plots for data insights and model results.

# Files :

- loan_default_prediction.ipynb: Notebook containing EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- correlation.csv: Correlation matrix data.
- train.csv / test.csv: Training and testing datasets.
- logreg_prediction.csv, rfc_prediction.csv, knn_prediction.csv, xgb_prediction.csv: Model prediction outputs.

# Technologies :
